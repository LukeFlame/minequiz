<h2 align="center">Challenges learned this week 🤯</h2>

   <p>
      Although it was only a week, I learned to organize my time and carry out projects with determination and focus. I learned several notions of design, project organization, database, known frameworks, etc. I am very grateful to DevSuperior for providing such an event, it was an incredible experience!<br>
