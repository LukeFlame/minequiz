<h2 align="center">Challenges learned this week</h2>

   <p>
      It was a great experience with the front end in this immersion, I learned fundamentals and fundamental techniques to build websites in the right way, I solved several proposed challenges that cost me several hours but rewarded me accordingly. NextJs has a lot of amazing features, I haven't been able to see them all yet, but I've already been interested in them!<br>
